"When you attach this code to an object, it allows you to sort objects with specific tags that enter the boundaries within a certain distance and find the closest object to you based on their distances. I wrote this code to determine the closest enemy characters to my character in the game. To use it, first attach a Sphere object to your character. Then make the sphere object invisible and check the 'isTrigger' option in its Collider settings. After that, attach this code to your sphere object. Finally, enter the tag you specified within the code. That's it."![Ekran görüntüsü 2024-06-24 005806](https://github.com/witnn/Unity-Closest-Object-Checker/assets/75940903/181997a7-5665-422a-bfa9-9e17d149e9ce)
